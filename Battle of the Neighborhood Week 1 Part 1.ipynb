    "New York City is the most populous city in the United States and it just might be the most diverse city on the planet, as it is home to over 8.6 million people and over 800 languages.\n",

    "The idea of this project is to categorically segment the neighborhoods of New York City into major clusters and examine their cuisines. A desirable intention is to examine the neighborhood cluster's food habits and taste. Further examination might reveal if food has any relationship with the diversity of a neighborhood.\n",

    "This project will help to understand the diversity of a neighborhood by leveraging venue data from Foursquare’s ‘Places API’ and ‘k-means clustering’ machine learning algorithm. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will help to discover further about the culture and diversity of the neighborhood. "
